# **Hanoon: A Mobile App for Easy Nutrition Label Analysis**  

## **Introduction**  
*Hanoon* is a mobile application designed to make nutrition labels more intuitive and accessible. Built around the concept of Nutri-Score and inspired by European and French solutions like ‘Yuka,’ the app aims to bridge the gap in South Korea by providing a digital tool to analyze nutrition labels with ease, focusing on protein sausage bars.  

## **Background**

## **Objective**  
The app allows users to scan product barcodes to quickly analyze nutritional information and make healthier food choices, addressing the need for accessible and impactful nutrition-focused digital tools in South Korea.  

## **Development Process**  
- **Functionality:** Defined and developed based on Nutri-Score principles and previous research findings.  
- **Usability Testing:** Conducted in collaboration with professional interface designers to refine the app.  
- **Final Prototype:** Evaluated using Peter Morville's Honeycomb model with quantitative surveys and qualitative usability testing.  

## **Results**  
The usability tests showed positive outcomes, with statistical and interview analyses confirming that *Hanoon* effectively improves users' understanding and usability of nutritional labels, enabling faster and more informed dietary decisions.
